# üåê AWS VPC Automation with Terraform & Jenkins (QA Perspective)


 
This project demonstrates **automated provisioning and validation of AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure** using Terraform, orchestrated through Jenkins CI/CD pipelines. The focus is on **accuracy, repeatability, and ensuring infrastructure behaves as intended**‚Äîcore QA principles applied to cloud environments.

---

### QA-Relevant Goals:

- Validate that VPC and networking resources are configured correctly every time
- Ensure changes to infrastructure are tested before deployment
- Automate checks to reduce human error and improve reliability
- Document infrastructure outcomes to support auditing and verification

--- 
## Skills Demonstrated (QA-Related):

- Automated verification of AWS VPC, subnets, route tables, and security groups
- Using Jenkins to trigger deployment pipelines and validate Terraform plans
- Ensuring infrastructure changes are consistent, repeatable, and auditable
- Applying process-oriented thinking to infrastructure deployment, mirroring QA workflows
- Tracking and documenting results for compliance and reproducibility

## Tech Stack:
- Terraform | Jenkins | AWS (VPC, Subnets, IGW, Route Tables, Security Groups) | CI/CD
---
## Impact / QA Takeaway:

- Highlights process validation, repeatable testing, and environment consistency
- Demonstrates ability to audit and verify infrastructure changes before they reach production
- Prepares for QA tasks such as configuration testing, regression-style environment checks, and automated verification
